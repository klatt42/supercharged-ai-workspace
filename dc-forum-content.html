                        <p>Our 1920s Capitol Hill rowhouse had a pipe burst in the basement during the February freeze. Water flooded our finished basement office and family room. The damage is extensive - warped hardwood floors, soaked drywall, ruined built-in bookshelves.</p>
                        <p>Insurance adjuster came out and estimated $12,000 for repairs. But three independent contractors all quoted between $28,000-$35,000 for proper restoration. The insurance company's "preferred" contractor agrees with their lowball estimate, of course.</p>
                        <p>My wife works from home in that basement office and we need it restored properly, not just patched up. How do DC residents handle insurance companies that won't pay for complete restoration?</p>

                        <p>Had the exact same issue with our Capitol Hill rowhouse last year! Insurance initially offered $8,000 for what ended up being $30,000 in proper restoration work.</p>

                        <p>Discovered extensive black mold in our Georgetown townhouse basement after noticing a musty smell. Our youngest child (5 years old) has been having respiratory issues and our pediatrician asked about mold exposure in our home.</p>
                        <p>Got estimates ranging from $18,000 to $28,000 for proper mold remediation. [Large National Insurance Carrier] denied our claim completely, saying mold damage isn't covered and that it's from "maintenance issues" not a covered event.</p>
                        <p>But we found evidence of a slow leak from an upstairs bathroom that's been going on for months without us knowing. Shouldn't this be covered as water damage? My child's health is being affected and we can't afford $25,000 out of pocket.</p>
                        <p>Any other Georgetown residents dealt with insurance mold denials? What are our options in DC?</p>

                            <p><strong>"Would you let your insurance company tell your pediatrician what's making your child sick?"</strong></p>
                            <p>Insurance adjusters aren't medical professionals. When your pediatrician asks about mold exposure, trust their medical expertise over an insurance company's cost-saving denial.</p>

                        <p><strong>DC Mold Coverage Strategy:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Water damage focus:</strong> The bathroom leak is the covered "sudden and accidental" water damage</li>
                            <li><strong>Consequential damage:</strong> Mold resulting from covered water damage may be covered</li>
                            <li><strong>Medical documentation:</strong> Your pediatrician's concerns strengthen your claim</li>
                            <li><strong>Independent assessment:</strong> Professional water damage evaluation can identify the covered cause</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Georgetown Townhouse Considerations:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Historic DC properties have unique moisture and ventilation challenges</li>
                            <li>Slow leaks in older plumbing systems are common and covered when discovered</li>
                            <li>Property values in Georgetown justify proper restoration, not cheap fixes</li>
                            <li>DC health department may assist with mold exposure documentation</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Child Safety Protocol:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Immediate air quality testing to document mold levels</li>
                            <li>HEPA air purifiers in your child's bedroom</li>
                            <li>Keep detailed health symptom log for pediatrician</li>
