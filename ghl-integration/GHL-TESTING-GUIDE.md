## **üîß TESTING METHODS AVAILABLE**

### **Method 1: Direct Webhook Processor Testing (‚úÖ Working)**
```bash
cd ghl-integration
python3 webhook-processor.py
```
**What it tests:** Core processing logic, regional routing, expert assignment, notification workflows

### **Method 2: Custom Webhook Data Testing**
Create test scenarios by modifying the webhook data in `webhook-processor.py`:

```python
# Emergency Test - Maryland Family
emergency_webhook = {
    "contact": {
        "name": "Sarah Johnson",
        "email": "sarah.johnson@email.com",
        "phone": "301-555-0123"
    },
    "message": "EMERGENCY! Basement flooding and my kids are getting sick!",
    "form_name": "Emergency Contact Form",
    "referrer": "https://independentrestoration.com/maryland-restoration.html"
}

# Standard Test - Virginia Homeowner
standard_webhook = {
    "contact": {
        "name": "Mike Williams",
        "email": "mike.w@email.com",
        "phone": "703-555-0456"
    },
    "message": "Water damage in basement. Can I choose my own contractor?",
    "form_name": "Contact Form",
    "referrer": "https://independentrestoration.com/virginia-restoration.html"
}
```

### **Method 3: Flask Server Testing (Requires Flask Installation)**
If you want to test the full HTTP webhook server:

```bash
# Install Flask (if needed)
pip3 install flask

# Start webhook server
python3 flask-webhook-server.py

# Test endpoints
curl http://localhost:5000/webhook/status
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/webhook/test -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"test": "data"}'
```

### **Method 4: GHL Form Integration Testing**
To test with actual GHL forms, configure these webhook URLs in your GoHighLevel account:

- **Emergency Forms:** `https://your-domain.com/webhook/emergency-contact`
- **Standard Forms:** `https://your-domain.com/webhook/forum-submission`
- **Consultation Forms:** `https://your-domain.com/webhook/consultation-request`
