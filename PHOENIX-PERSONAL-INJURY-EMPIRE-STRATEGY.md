## üíÄ **DR. SARAH HOOK** - Death Psychology Applications

### **Legal Death Psychology Framework Adaptation**

**Primary Hook Point**: Medical Examiner Standard‚Ñ¢
> **"Would you let the insurance company's doctor examine your injuries?  
> Then why let them choose your personal injury lawyer?"**

### **Death Psychology Integration Points**

**üéØ Psychological Triggers for Legal Context**:
1. **Medical Examiner Absurdity**: Everyone knows insurance doctors are biased
2. **Injury Mortality**: Physical harm connects to death psychology
3. **Financial Survival**: Lost income = family survival threat  
4. **Justice Authority**: Who decides your compensation fate?
5. **Recovery Stakes**: Proper legal representation = life recovery

### **Hook Point Variations for A/B Testing**

**Variant A (85% traffic): Medical Examiner Analogy**
- **Hook**: "Insurance company doctors vs your choice of lawyer"
- **Psychology**: Medical authority bias ‚Üí Legal authority bias
- **Trigger**: Health examination trust ‚Üí Legal representation trust

**Variant B (10% traffic): Financial Survival**
- **Hook**: "Your family's financial survival depends on YOUR lawyer choice"
- **Psychology**: Economic mortality salience
- **Trigger**: Family provider responsibility ‚Üí Action urgency

**Variant C (5% traffic): Justice Authority**  
- **Hook**: "They control the medical exam AND your legal representation?"
- **Psychology**: Double authority manipulation anger
- **Trigger**: Injustice recognition ‚Üí Fighting back response

### **Content Psychology Architecture**

**Death Psychology Word Integration (Target: 75+ triggers)**:
- **Medical Context**: examination, diagnosis, treatment, recovery, healing
- **Legal Context**: justice, protection, survival, life-changing, critical
- **Family Context**: provider, security, future, legacy, protection

**Visual Death Psychology**:
- **Colors**: Deep blue (trust) ‚Üí Red (injury/urgency) ‚Üí Gold (justice)
- **Medical Imagery**: Stethoscope ‚Üí Gavel progression

### **SEO-GEO-Hook Integration**

**Phoenix-Specific Optimization**:
- "Phoenix personal injury lawyer YOUR choice not insurance"  
- "Arizona accident attorney independent medical exam bias"
- "Wrongful death Phoenix insurance company doctor conflict"

**AI-Optimized Summary Boxes**:
> "In Summary: Would you trust the insurance company's doctor to fairly examine your injuries? Of course not - they work for the insurance company, not you. The same principle applies to personal injury lawyers. Your family's financial recovery depends on choosing YOUR independent attorney, not accepting whoever the insurance company prefers..."
